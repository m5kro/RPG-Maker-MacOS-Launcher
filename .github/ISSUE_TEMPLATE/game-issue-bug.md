# Game Issue/Bug

Note:
I only help out with NWjs based games (MV/MZ), and most of the time, I can't fix it
For VXA, VX, and XP issues please go to: https://github.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z
For 2000/2003 issues please go to: https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player
If you can't tell, open the issue and I'll let you know if I can't help
